# BrainHack-DiffusionKit-Trial
playing around with Xie et al., 2016 "DiffusionKit", running this bash script in a Jupyter Notebook 
this was mainly for practice purposes; I used the tutorial, script & sample data from https://diffusionkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
Sangma Xie, Liangfu Chen, Nianming Zuo and Tianzi Jiang, DiffusionKit: A Light One-Stop Solution for Diffusion MRI Data Analysis, Journal of Neuroscience Methods, vol. 273, pp. 107-119, 2016.
